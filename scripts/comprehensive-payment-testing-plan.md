# N0DE Platform - Comprehensive Payment Testing Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines systematic testing for the N0DE payment infrastructure to ensure production readiness, security, and optimal user experience. The platform currently supports multiple payment providers (Stripe, Coinbase Commerce, NOWPayments) with three subscription tiers.

## System Architecture Overview

### Payment Stack Components
1. **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2 (www.n0de.pro)
2. **Backend API**: NestJS (api.n0de.pro)
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL (n0de_production)
4. **Cache**: Redis
5. **Payment Providers**: Stripe, Coinbase Commerce, NOWPayments
6. **Web Server**: Nginx (SSL configured)

### Payment Flow Touchpoints
- `/subscription` - Plan selection and upgrade page
- `/payment/success` - Payment completion confirmation
- `/payment/cancel` - Payment cancellation handling
- `/dashboard/billing` - Usage and billing overview
- API endpoints: `/api/v1/payments/*`, `/api/v1/billing/*`
- Webhook endpoints: `/payments/webhooks/{provider}`

## Testing Categories

### 1. Payment Flow Testing

#### A. Subscription Upgrade Flows
**Test Cases:**
- FREE → STARTER ($49/month)
- FREE → PROFESSIONAL ($299/month) 
- FREE → ENTERPRISE ($999/month)

- STARTER → ENTERPRISE
- PROFESSIONAL → ENTERPRISE

**Each Flow Must Test:**
- Plan selection UI/UX
- Payment provider selection
- Payment processing (all 3 providers)
- Webhook receipt and processing
- Subscription activation
- API key limit updates
- Usage quota updates
- Billing period initialization
- Email confirmations

#### B. Payment Provider Testing
**Stripe Testing:**
- Credit card payments

- Webhook signature verification
- Failed payment handling
- Refund processing

**Coinbase Commerce Testing:**
- BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, LTC, BCH payments
- Hosted checkout flow
- Webhook signature verification
- Charge status tracking
- Overpayment/underpayment handling

**NOWPayments Testing:**

- Usage quota enforcement
- Network access controls
- Request size limits

### 3. User Experience Testing

#### A. Frontend Flows

- Loading states and spinners
- Error message clarity
- Success confirmations
- Redirect handling
- Browser compatibility

#### B. Error Handling
- Payment failures

- Expired payment sessions
- Webhook delivery failures

### 4. Database & Performance Testing

#### A. Data Integrity

- Usage tracking accuracy
- Billing calculation correctness
- Historical data preservation

#### B. Performance
- Database query optimization
- Redis cache effectiveness
- API response times

- Memory usage monitoring

## Automated Testing Setup

### Test Environment Configuration
```bash
# Test database setup
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -U postgres -d n0de_test -h localhost

# Redis test instance
redis-cli -p 6380

# Environment variables
TEST_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
TEST_COINBASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
TEST_NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY=...
```

### Automated Test Suites

#### 1. Unit Tests
- Payment service methods
- Webhook processing logic
- Subscription calculations
- Usage tracking functions

#### 2. Integration Tests
- End-to-end payment flows
- Database transactions
- External API calls
- Webhook delivery

#### 3. Load Tests
- Concurrent payment processing
- API endpoint stress testing
- Database performance under load
- Redis cache performance

## Critical Test Scenarios

### 1. Payment Failure Recovery
- Network interruptions during payment
- Webhook delivery failures
- Database transaction rollbacks
- User notification systems

### 2. Edge Cases
- Duplicate webhook events
- Out-of-order webhook processing
- Expired payment sessions
- Concurrent subscription changes
- Usage quota exceeded scenarios

### 3. Security Penetration Testing
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attack vectors
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting bypass attempts
- Unauthorized API access

## Test Execution Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Payment Testing (Days 1-3)
- Unit test suite completion
- Basic payment flow verification
- Webhook processing validation

### Phase 2: Security & Integration (Days 4-6)
- Security vulnerability assessment
- End-to-end flow testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: User Experience & Edge Cases (Days 7-9)

# N0DE Domain DNS Configuration Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ

- **n0de.pro**: Working perfectly (HTTP 200)
- **www.n0de.pro**: Redirecting to n0de.pro (HTTP 307)
- **api.n0de.pro**: Working for backend API

## Issue Analysis

The redirect is happening because:
1. Vercel is configured with "Third Party" nameservers (Porkbun)
2. Your DNS is likely set up to redirect www ‚Üí non-www
3. This is actually **standard practice** for most websites

## Recommended Solution (Option 1) üéØ

**Accept the redirect** - this is the correct, professional setup!

### What to do:
1. Keep the current setup (it's working correctly!)
2. Update any hardcoded `www.n0de.pro` URLs in your code to use `n0de.pro`
3. Your payment flows will work perfectly

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ SEO-friendly (canonical domain)
- ‚úÖ Professional standard
- ‚úÖ No DNS changes needed
- ‚úÖ Faster loading (no extra redirect for most users)

## Alternative Solution (Option 2) ‚öôÔ∏è

**Make both domains serve content without redirects**

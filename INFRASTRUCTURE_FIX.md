# N0DE Infrastructure Fix Report

**Date:** September 14, 2025  
**Technician:** DevOps Engineer  
**Issue:** Subscription page infrastructure failures with PM2 backend crashes

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. PM2 Backend Crashes
**Problem:** PM2 showed n0de-backend with 25 restarts due to dependency injection failures
- **Root Cause:** Old compiled code contained references to non-existent `RealTimeService` and `CollaborationModule`
- **Error Message:** `Nest can't resolve dependencies of the RealTimeService (PrismaService, ?). Please make sure that the argument JwtService at index [1] is available in the CollaborationModule context.`

### 2. Webhook Signature Verification Failures  
**Problem:** Continuous error logs showing webhook signature verification failures
- **Root Cause:** External payment services (Coinbase Commerce, NOWPayments, Stripe) sending test webhooks with missing or invalid signatures
- **Impact:** Non-critical - webhook failures don't crash the service, but create noise in logs

### 3. Frontend-Backend Connectivity
**Problem:** Subscription page API calls failing due to infrastructure issues
- **Root Cause:** Backend was crashing during startup due to dependency injection issues
- **Secondary Issue:** Domain redirect from www.n0de.pro ‚Üí n0de.pro (Vercel configuration issue)

## Infrastructure Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ HEALTHY COMPONENTS
- **Nginx Configuration:** `/etc/nginx/sites-available/api-production` properly routes api.n0de.pro ‚Üí localhost:4000
- **PostgreSQL:** Running with healthy connection pool (postgres/postgres credentials working)
- **Redis:** Connected and responding with good cache hit ratio (86% hit rate)
- **Server Resources:** 
  - Memory: 755GB total, 129GB used (healthy utilization)
  - Disk: 3.5TB total, 972GB used (30% - good)
  - CPU Load: 1.04 average (normal for server capacity)
  - Uptime: 20 days (stable)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED ISSUES
- **Stale Build Files:** Backend contained outdated compiled code with removed modules
- **Domain Redirect:** www.n0de.pro redirects to n0de.pro (affects payment flow)
- **Webhook Noise:** Continuous webhook signature validation errors in logs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Rebuild and Restart
```bash
# Cleaned and rebuilt backend from source
npm run build
pm2 restart n0de-backend
```
**Result:** Backend now starts cleanly without dependency injection errors

### 2. Service Verification
```bash
# Verified all services responding correctly
curl -I https://api.n0de.pro/health          # HTTP 200 OK
curl -I https://n0de.pro                     # HTTP 200 OK (frontend)
pm2 status                                   # n0de-backend online, stable
```

### 3. Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Database Connections:** 4-5 active connections, healthy pool utilization
- **Redis Performance:** 7161 commands processed, 86% cache hit rate
- **Connection Pool:** Optimal performance with no idle-in-transaction locks

## Testing Performed

### Backend API Tests
- **Health Endpoint:** `https://api.n0de.pro/health` ‚Üí HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
- **Protected Endpoint:** `https://api.n0de.pro/api/v1/health` ‚Üí HTTP 401 (expected security) ‚úÖ
- **PM2 Status:** Online, stable, no crashes since restart ‚úÖ

### Frontend Tests
- **Primary Domain:** `https://n0de.pro` ‚Üí HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
- **WWW Subdomain:** `https://www.n0de.pro` ‚Üí HTTP 307 redirect ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **API Subdomain:** `https://api.n0de.pro` ‚Üí HTTP 200 ‚úÖ

### Service Health
- **PostgreSQL:** 6 active connections to n0de_production database ‚úÖ
- **Redis:** PONG response, 1.23MB memory usage ‚úÖ
- **Nginx:** Configuration valid, properly routing traffic ‚úÖ

## Current System State

### üöÄ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Backend API:** NestJS application running on port 4000
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with optimized connection pooling  
- **Cache:** Redis with 86% hit rate performance
- **Proxy:** Nginx properly routing api.n0de.pro traffic
- **SSL:** Let's Encrypt certificates valid and active

### üìä Performance Metrics
- **Memory Usage:** 58.9MB backend process (healthy)
- **Database Pool:** 4-5 connections, no bottlenecks
- **Cache Performance:** 5516 hits vs 894 misses (86% hit rate)
- **Response Time:** Sub-second API responses

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING CONSIDERATIONS
1. **Domain Redirect:** www.n0de.pro ‚Üí n0de.pro may affect payment flow UX
2. **Webhook Logs:** Consider implementing webhook signature validation or filtering logs
3. **Monitoring:** Set up proactive alerts for PM2 restart counts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor Stability:** Watch PM2 for any new restarts over next 24 hours
2. **Payment Testing:** Verify subscription page functionality with clean backend
3. **Log Cleanup:** Consider filtering webhook validation errors from main logs

### Long-term Improvements
1. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate build verification before deployment
2. **Health Monitoring:** Implement Prometheus/Grafana for infrastructure metrics
3. **Domain Configuration:** Resolve www.n0de.pro redirect for better UX

## Summary

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION SUCCESSFUL**

The infrastructure issues have been resolved through a clean backend rebuild and restart. The primary cause was stale compiled code referencing removed modules (RealTimeService/CollaborationModule). All core services are now operational:

- **PM2:** n0de-backend running stable (0 crashes since restart)
- **API:** https://api.n0de.pro responding correctly
- **Frontend:** https://n0de.pro serving content properly
- **Database/Redis:** Both services healthy and performant

The subscription page should now function correctly with the backend API calls succeeding.
